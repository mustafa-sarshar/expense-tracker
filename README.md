# expense-tracker

## OBJECTIVES
This Repo aims at developing a simple react-native app to track the personal expenses.
This Repo is 100% inspired by the wonderful online course, taught by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/share/101Wau3@TH09G-aj7LcNvFSFRifymDFRgyaF4e9MOREqXB0G5zuibd4Oze2Mhe0sDFxHn0aK/). So, let's shout out to him for his wonderful course.

## NOTES

- To use the app, use must create a json file in the root directory, named .firebaseConfigs.json, and add the following data to it:

```json
{
  "dbConfigs": {
    "url": "https://****YOUR_BACKEND_URL****.firebaseio.com",
    "collectionName": "expenses"
  }
}
```
